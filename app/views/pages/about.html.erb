    <p class="lead">
        My name is Harrison Kunkel, I created this website to be my resume. I was introduced to programming when
        I was at community college while working for my mathematics and engineering associates degree. As my classes became more advanced, 
        I was exposed to more programming. This caused my passion for programming to grow, and shortly after graduating commuinty college I started reseaching 
        Ruby on Rails in hopes of becoming a full stack web developer.
