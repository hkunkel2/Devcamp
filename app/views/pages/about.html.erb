                My name is Harrison Kunkel, I created this website to be my resume. I was introduced to programming when
                I was at community college while working for my mathematics and engineering associates degree. As my classes became more advanced, 
                I was exposed to more programming. This caused my passion for programming to grow, and shortly after graduating commuinty college I started reseaching 
                Ruby on Rails in hopes of becoming a full stack web developer.
